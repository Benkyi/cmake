# Building portable code with [CMake](https://cmake.org)

CMake is a popular open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to
build, test and package software.  In this lesson we will discover and apply
various CMake building blocks. We will exercise applying the material by
configuring and building an
[example mixed Fortran-C++ project](https://github.com/bast/fizz-buzz)
using CMake.


## Prerequisites

1. You need to install [CMake, as well as Fortran, C, and C++ compilers](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/).

2. It helps to have some prior exposure to Makefiles and compiled languages.
