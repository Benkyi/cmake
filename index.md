# Building portable code with [CMake](https://cmake.org)

CMake is a popular open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to
build, test and package software.

In this lesson we will motivate the use of Make and CMake discover and apply
various CMake building blocks. We will exercise applying the material by
configuring and building an
[example mixed Fortran-C++ project](https://github.com/bast/fizz-buzz)
using CMake.


## Contributions welcome

The material is not well tested on Windows because the lesson authors are
Linux/Mac people. Corrections and contributions which make the lesson more
general and portable are very much welcome.


## Prerequisites

1. You need to install [CMake, as well as Fortran, C, and C++ compilers](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/).

2. To appreciate this material it helps to have some prior exposure to
   Makefiles and compiled languages.
