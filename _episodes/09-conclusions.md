## Conclusions

- Powerful cross-platform build systems generator
- Very good reference-style documentation
- For larger projects you probably want to write a lightweight scaffold around CMake

### Critique

- Absolute paths (you cannot move a configured project to a different path)
- Very few good *and* free CMake tutorials
- "Mastering CMake" book is not freely available as online version
